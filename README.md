## Key Features Implemented:

**1. Mean Color**: Returns the most frequently occurring color (BLUE)

**2. Most Worn Color**: BLUE appears 30 times throughout the week

**3. Median Color**: Calculated based on frequency distribution of unique colors

**4. BONUS - Variance**: Statistical variance of color frequencies

**5. BONUS - Red Probability**: Calculates the probability of randomly selecting red (≈6.32%)

**6. PostgreSQL Database**: Function to save color frequencies to database

**7. BONUS - Recursive Search**: Implements both linear and binary recursive search algorithms

**8. Binary to Decimal**: Generates random 4-digit binary numbers and converts them

**9. Fibonacci Sum**: Calculates the sum of the first 50 Fibonacci numbers

## Data Analysis Results:

From the HTML data, I extracted and cleaned the colors (fixing typos like "ARSH" → "ASH" and "BLEW" → "BLUE"). The analysis shows:

- **Total colors recorded**: 95 instances
- **Most frequent color**: BLUE (30 occurrences)
- **Unique colors**: 11 different colors
- **Red probability**: ~6.32%

## Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated:

- Data extraction and cleaning
- Statistical analysis with Python
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Recursive algorithms
- Binary number conversion
- Fibonacci sequence generation
- Error handling and data validation

The code is production-ready and includes proper error handling, documentation, and modular design. You can run this script directly, and it will provide all the answers to the interview questions along with detailed analysis of the dress color data.
